# Employee Loan Management System - Migration Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the migration from the previous single `User` entity system to a new multi-entity role-based system with **Employee**, **Admin**, **LoanOfficer**, and **Accountant** as separate entities.

---

## What Changed?

### 1. Entity Structure

#### Previous Structure
- Single `User` entity with a `Role` enum (ADMIN, EMPLOYEE)
- User table stored all users regardless of their role

#### New Structure
- **UserBase**: Abstract base class with common fields (id, name, email, password)
- **Employee**: Extends UserBase, has `department` field
- **Admin**: Extends UserBase, has `adminRole` field
- **LoanOfficer**: Extends UserBase
- **Accountant**: Extends UserBase

Each role now has its own database table:
- `employees`
- `admins`
- `loan_officers`
- `accountants`

### 2. Entity Relationships

#### LoanApplication
- **Before**: `user` (ManyToOne to User), `approvedBy` (ManyToOne to User)
- **After**: `employee` (ManyToOne to Employee), `loanOfficer` (ManyToOne to LoanOfficer)

#### Repayment
- **Before**: Only `loanApplication` relationship
- **After**: Added `accountant` (ManyToOne to Accountant) to track who processed the repayment

#### LoanType
- **Added**: `interestRate` field (BigDecimal)

### 3. New Repositories
Created separate repositories for each entity:
- `EmployeeRepository`
- `AdminRepository`
- `LoanOfficerRepository`
- `AccountantRepository`

### 4. New Services
Created dedicated services for managing each user type:
- `EmployeeService`
- `AdminService`
- `LoanOfficerService`
- `AccountantService`
- `UnifiedAuthService` - Handles authentication across all user types

### 5. Updated Services
- **LoanApplicationService**: Now works with `Employee` and `LoanOfficer`
- **RepaymentService**: Now tracks which `Accountant` processed each repayment
- **CustomUserDetailsService**: Checks all four repositories for authentication

### 6. New Controllers
Created controllers for each user type:
- `EmployeeController` - `/api/employees`
- `AdminController` - `/api/admins`
- `LoanOfficerController` - `/api/loan-officers`
- `AccountantController` - `/api/accountants`

### 7. Updated Controllers
- **AuthController**: 
  - Uses `UnifiedAuthService` for login
  - Separate registration endpoints for each user type:
    - `POST /api/auth/register/employee`
    - `POST /api/auth/register/admin`
    - `POST /api/auth/register/loan-officer`
    - `POST /api/auth/register/accountant`

- **LoanApplicationController**:
  - Updated role-based access controls
  - Changed `/user/{userId}` to `/employee/{employeeId}`
  - Updated PreAuthorize annotations to include new roles

## Database Migration Steps

### Step 1: Backup Current Database
```bash
cp employee_loans.db employee_loans_backup.db
```

### Step 2: Start the Application
The application will auto-create the new tables based on JPA entities:
- `employees`
- `admins`
- `loan_officers`
- `accountants`

### Step 3: Data Migration (If Needed)
If you have existing data in the old `users` table, you'll need to migrate it:

```sql
-- Example migration queries (adjust as needed)

-- Migrate Employees
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, email, password, department)
SELECT id, name, email, password, 'General' 
FROM users WHERE role = 'EMPLOYEE';

-- Migrate Admins
INSERT INTO admins (id, name, email, password, admin_role)
SELECT id, name, email, password, 'Super Admin'
FROM users WHERE role = 'ADMIN';

-- Update LoanApplication references
UPDATE loan_applications 
SET employee_id = user_id;
```

### Step 4: Verify Data Integrity
- Check that all user records have been migrated
- Verify loan applications are linked correctly
- Test authentication with each user type

---

## Testing the New System

### 1. Create Test Users
```bash
# Create an Employee
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register/employee \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@company.com", "password": "password123", "department": "IT"}'

# Create a Loan Officer
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register/loan-officer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane@company.com", "password": "password123"}'

# Create an Accountant
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register/accountant \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Bob Finance", "email": "bob@company.com", "password": "password123"}'

# Create an Admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register/admin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Admin User", "email": "admin@company.com", "password": "password123", "adminRole": "Super Admin"}'
```

### 2. Test Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "john@company.com", "password": "password123"}'
```

### 3. Test Loan Workflow
1. **Employee** applies for loan
2. **Loan Officer** reviews and approves
3. **Accountant** processes repayments
4. **Admin** monitors overall system

---

## Breaking Changes

### Frontend Updates Required

1. **Update Login Response Handling**
   - Role is now returned as string: "EMPLOYEE", "ADMIN", "LOAN_OFFICER", "ACCOUNTANT"
   - Update role checks in frontend routing

2. **Update API Endpoints**
   - Change `/api/loans/user/{id}` to `/api/loans/employee/{id}`
   - Use new registration endpoints

3. **Update Role-Based UI**
   - Add conditional rendering for new roles
   - Update navigation menus for each role type

4. **Update Forms**
   - Add department field for Employee registration
   - Add adminRole field for Admin registration

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Role-Based Access**: Ensure proper `PreAuthorize` annotations on all endpoints
2. **Password Encoding**: All passwords are encrypted using BCrypt
3. **JWT Tokens**: Include role information in token claims
4. **Data Isolation**: Each role can only access their authorized data

---

## Rollback Plan

If migration fails:
1. Restore backup database: `mv employee_loans_backup.db employee_loans.db`
2. Revert to previous code version
3. Restart application

---

## Support

For issues or questions regarding the migration:
- Check application logs for errors
- Verify database schema matches expected structure
- Test each role's permissions individually
- Ensure JWT configuration includes new roles

---

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Backend entities, services, and controllers updated
2. ðŸ”„ Update frontend to work with new API structure
3. ðŸ”„ Create seed data script for initial system setup
4. ðŸ”„ Update documentation and API specs
5. ðŸ”„ Add integration tests for new roles
6. ðŸ”„ Update deployment scripts

---

## Summary

This migration introduces a more robust role-based access system with dedicated entities for each user type. This provides:
- **Better data organization**
- **Clearer role separation**
- **Enhanced security**
- **Easier auditing**
- **Scalability for future role additions**

The new structure aligns with the project requirements and provides a solid foundation for the Employee Loan Management System.
