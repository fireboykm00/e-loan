# Employee Loan Management System - Bug Fixes

## Date: October 26, 2024

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. **User Registration Authorization** ✅
**Problem:** Admin could not create accountants and loan officers; user registration endpoints were not properly secured.

**Solution:** Added `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")` to all registration endpoints in `AuthController.java`:
- `/api/auth/register/employee`
- `/api/auth/register/admin`
- `/api/auth/register/loan-officer`
- `/api/auth/register/accountant`

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/main/java/com/unilak/employeeloan/controller/AuthController.java`

---

#### 2. **Reports Access for Accountant and Loan Officer** ✅
**Problem:** Reports were restricted to ADMIN only, preventing accountants and loan officers from accessing them.

**Solution:** Updated `@PreAuthorize` annotation on `ReportController` class from `hasRole('ADMIN')` to `hasAnyRole('ADMIN', 'LOAN_OFFICER', 'ACCOUNTANT')`.

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/main/java/com/unilak/employeeloan/controller/ReportController.java`

---

#### 3. **Repayment API Authorization** ✅
**Problem:** Repayment endpoints lacked proper authorization checks.

**Solution:** Added proper `@PreAuthorize` annotations to all repayment endpoints:
- `GET /api/repayments` - ADMIN, ACCOUNTANT
- `GET /api/repayments/loan/{loanId}` - ADMIN, ACCOUNTANT, LOAN_OFFICER
- `POST /api/repayments` - ADMIN, ACCOUNTANT

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/main/java/com/unilak/employeeloan/controller/RepaymentController.java`

---

#### 4. **Repayment Processing and Outstanding Balance** ✅
**Problem:** Loan outstanding balance was not properly updated after repayments, causing dashboard statistics to show incorrect data.

**Solution:** Updated `RepaymentService.createRepayment()` to:
- Add the repayment to the loan's repayments collection (maintains bidirectional relationship)
- Save the loan after adding the repayment to persist changes
- Auto-complete loan status when fully paid

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/main/java/com/unilak/employeeloan/service/RepaymentService.java`
